    Technical discussion about the Interledger specs and reference
    implementation are done mainly through Github issues and pull requests.
    Watch the [Interledger RFCs repo](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs) for
    updates to the specs and the projects under the [Interledger.js
    organization](https://github.com/interledgerjs) for developments on the
    reference implementation.

    We have open community calls **once a month, on the second Wednesday of the month at 4pm UTC** to discuss the latest in the Interledger ecosystem, and to answer any questions people have. Agendas are published on the Interledger forum and anyone can suggest an agenda item by adding to the [topic](https://forum.interledger.org/tags/community-call-agenda) created for that purpose in the forum.

    Recordings of previous calls are available on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/interledger) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@InterledgerFoundation).
